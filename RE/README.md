There is so much software in the wild which are close-sourced and all we have is just executables or machine code. It is very interesting to know how a software works, what it does, understand it's internal functioning, data structures-algorithms involved.

You will be given a bunch of executables. You'll need to get the flag by tearing the executable apart. For this, you'll need several things. You'll need to run the program with crazy inputs, read assembly code, run it through your toolset and try out any crazy method you can think of.

**Topics**: Systems, Algorithms, Assembly Programming
