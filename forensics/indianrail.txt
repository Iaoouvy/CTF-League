we need to find out where our friend is planning to keep the christmas party so 
we all a little group of hackers try to use our skills and find out without asking him 
and then give him a surprise.
for now we know that he is booking train tickets and most likely
from the usual site indianrail.gov.in so captured his network traffic as we also are connected 
to the same wifi network to which he is.
can you help us find out where he is going and by which train?
