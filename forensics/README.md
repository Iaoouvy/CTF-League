# forensics

Suppose you are trying to solve a murder and you are the lead investigator. What do you do? You search for fingerprints, potential murder weapons, anything that will help identify the killer. 

Here, we are talking about digital forensics. There might be challenges where you might have to go through a server's logs, firewall's packet captures or analysis of some malware which infected the server or analysis of an unknown file format.

**Topics**: File Formats, Malware, Steganography etc.,
