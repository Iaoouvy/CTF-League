## Problem

The following is given to you: 
```
CTF-League{(-1.831239,-78.183403),(9.081999,8.675277),(51.165691,10.451526),(20.593683,78.962883),(9.081999,8.675277),(26.820553,30.802498),(9.145000,40.489674),(61.524010,105.318756),(44.016521,21.005859)}
```

You need to capture the flag!

## Solution

There are 9 pairs of floating point numbers given to us. We need to make sense out of them.

**Key**: Each pair is the co-ordinates of a location.

Google is your friend, get the flag by getting the locations.
